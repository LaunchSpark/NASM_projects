; CSC 3410 Assignment 2 - Program 3 instructions
; - Prompt the user for two single-digit numbers, convert each from ASCII to a value, and store them.
; - Use IDIV to divide the first number by the second number (quotient in AL, remainder in AH).
; - After the division, convert the results back to ASCII and print them as:
;     "The quotient is: <quotient>" on one line
;     "The remainder is: <remainder>" on the next line.
; - Assume all values remain single-digit results just like in programs 1 and 2.
